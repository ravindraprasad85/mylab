LAYER-1 or Outer Layer # When 
* Any technique which help machine to act smart 
* Instructing robot to play chess

LAYER-2 MACHINE LAYERS
* When machine start learning itself from data pattern 
* Instead of coding and feeding the data , its start learning
* Student study hours and student marks obtained pattern 
* Machine Learning is the equal to giving the machine a memory of examples not the rules
* Scikit Learn is Machine Learning tool

LAYER-3 DEEP LEARNING (USE NURONS and STRONG MATHS)
* A smart powerfull brain which would be inside Machine Learning
* It will try to mimic that how human brain works Like Face recognition (USING NURONS)
* Its require 
    1. Huge Data
    2. Lots of Power
* Image Recognition, Auto Drive Car, House Price, Student Pass, Medical predict (Using learning Pattern)


ROLE    MEANING
AI      Entire School
ML      Class-1, Class-2, Class-3 ..... (Works with Rules DEPENDENT)
DL      Students learning new skils and expertise like singing, dancing, paiting, acting..etc (Works without any Rule ...INDEPENDENT)
