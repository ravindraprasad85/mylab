Why should i focus in mathmatics in DATA Science

* Understand Models
* Debug Effectively
* Train as a Real Scientist

Mean= Its an Average Value ===============>Sum of all Numbers / Devide by number
Median= Middle Value
Mode= Which number comes mostly 
Percentage= Compare with 100 (Its not precise value)
Ratio= 100 Balls 60 run (60:100)
Accuracy= (Corrected Prediction / Total Prediction ) * 100
Precision= (True Positove / Total predictive positives)
Recall= (True positive / Total actual positive)


Basic Algebra=
Y=mx+b
m = slope (of Graph) like per day wages 
x = days/question
b = 
Y = output/Answer

Vectors= List of Numbers which tell us (Position, Measorment, Distance) 
    It used to store bunch of data like many students scores all together 
Ex: 
    Hight:Weight Ratio
    (3,4) steps left + 4 step right 
    Latitude:Lognitude 

Standard Deviation=
