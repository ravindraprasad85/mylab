LAYER-2 MACHINE LAYERS
* When machine start learning itself from data pattern 
* Instead of coding and feeding the data , its start learning
* Student study hours and student marks obtained pattern 
* Machine Learning is the equal to giving the machine a memory of examples not the rules
* Scikit Learn is Machine Learning tool


Which type of Machine Learning should be used

## Supervised Learning (Feed INPUT + OUTPUT)
    * Ideal for task with labeld data which the desired data is known
    * Ex: A teacher given the Q & A for sum and then asking questions from same pattern (like sum here)

## Unsupervised Learning (Feed ONLY INPUT)
    * Entering into a party where all are unknown and then identifying by labeling (Used in unlabeled data)
        * By cloths, office or formal dress
        * By teen, adult age
        * By dancing, eating
    * We created clusters based on pattern 
    * We only get the input but not the answers like above we tried to create group and segmentation 
    * Marketting, Fraud Detection, 

## Reinforcement Learning (ACTIONS + REWARDS)
    * Best for training agents to make decisions tgrough interaction with an environment
    * We trained a DOG and given buiscuit once followed and punished/trained when not followed
    * 

## CORE MACHINE LEARNING CONCEPTS OVERVIEW
* INPUT (X) #Question
* OUTPUT (y) #Answer
* Model 
     Creating rules like when increasing +1 study hours , +5 marks are increasing (creating a math formula which called Model)
    * This will help to create a Model ..it will help to train the pattern 
    * Based on the Model by feeding rules , It will help to predict the pattern    
* Training 
    * Creating a formula and insrcting to predict based on the Model/Formula (Scikit Learn use fit)
* Testing
    * We will provide a new data and test the prediction based on trained Model
    * Study hours 70 and test the predicted marks 
* Prediction
    * Keep check the Prediction based on trained Model
